# Metaheuristic Portfolio Optimizer

## Overview
**Metaheuristic Portfolio Optimizer** is a user-friendly application for optimizing asset allocations using metaheuristic optimization algorithms. It aims to **maximize the Sharpe Ratio** of a portfolio using historical asset return data.

Supported optimization techniques:
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Simulated Annealing (SA)
- Hybrid PSO-GA

Users can upload their own **CSV or Excel** datasets, run different optimizers, visualize allocations with a pie chart, and compare performance.

Also included: a **Jupyter Notebook** that walks through the algorithm logic for learning or presentation purposes.

## Features
- Supports CSV and Excel data uploads
- Visualizes optimized portfolio allocations
- Multiple optimizer options (PSO, GA, SA, Hybrid)
- Sharpe Ratio performance comparison table
- Educational Jupyter Notebook included
